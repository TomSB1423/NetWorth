# Your Dashboard

The Dashboard is the heart of the Networth experience. It is designed to give you immediate insight into your financial situation.

## What You'll See

### Net Worth Summary

At the top of the page, you will see your **Total Net Worth**. This is the sum of all your assets (like savings and investments) minus your liabilities (like loans and credit card debt).

### Account Breakdown

Below the summary, you can explore individual accounts. Each connected bank account is listed with its current balance, so you can see exactly where your money is.

### Historical Trends

(Coming Soon)
Visual graphs will help you track your progress over time, showing you how your net worth has grown or changed month over month.

## User Experience

We prioritize a clean and intuitive interface. The dashboard is responsive, meaning it looks great whether you are on your computer, tablet, or phone.

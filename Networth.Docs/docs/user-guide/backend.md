# Security & Privacy

We understand that your financial data is sensitive. That's why security is built into the core of Networth.

## How We Protect Your Data

### Secure Connections

All communication between your browser, our servers, and your financial institutions is encrypted using industry-standard protocols. This ensures that no one can intercept your data while it's in transit.

### No Stored Credentials

Networth does not store your online banking usernames or passwords. This means even if our database were compromised, your bank login details would remain safe.

### Privacy First

Your data belongs to you. We do not sell your personal financial information to third parties. The data we collect is used solely to provide you with the Networth service.
